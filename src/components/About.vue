        People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its
        end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the
        experience.\n\nThis phenomenon is refered to as the Peak-End Rule.

      <p>
        Rating movies is a puerly subjective art form. While this app can not make
        rating movies objective, it can solve the Peak-End Rule, and at a minimum, give
        you a way to compaire a feature film to any other on a one-to-one basis.

        There are 5 trends that are tracked. Each trened represents an aspect that can
        have high impact on a feature films enjoyment. The five trends are tracked in
        real time to create a perennial heart beat that you can use to know exactly how
        one felt durring the entertainment. While currently there are only five trends
        that are tracked, this may change in the future to allow custom trends.

        When a movie is finished a final rating is given. A rating is formed by taking
