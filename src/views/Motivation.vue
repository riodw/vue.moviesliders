        This is a project that I’ve wanted to make for a while. I’ve wanted to create an
        iOS App just for practice. This seemed like a perfect first project.

        Netflix is amazing, truly. I, like so many others enjoy a good Netflix show.
      </p>
      <p>
        See, I grew up in a family that did not have TV. We had a “TV” but only a VHS
        player for it. It’s been interesting watching my family slowly evolve into a
        typical family who enjoys a good TV show. Anyway, I recently watched the Netflix
        Series
        <strong>
          “The OA”
        </strong>
        .
      </p>
      <h2>
        AND IT WAS TERRIBLE!
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was so terrible that it inspired me to create this app. I just felt this need
        for a way to express my contempt for such an atrocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did suffer through the entire series, but every single episode felt like I was
        being accosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I so deeply wanted a way to express my hatred for this show. I hated it so much
        I started passive-aggressively sliding my fingers up and down in the air on
        imaginary levers that to me represented a slider for how awful it was. I then
        began sliding my fingers up and down so much that it became an almost
        subconscious action.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when the idea came to me.
